This package is under development, and many parts are still considered experimental.

15/07/2009   Version 0.4-1
- bug fix in function fix.design: error checking for changed factors 
  had a bug and stopped perfectly legal edits from being stored.


13/07/2009   Version 0.4
- all experimental factors are now R-factors, even if they are numeric
- export.design can now also export the R workspace only, without csv or html
- bugfix: export.design did not correctly check replacing of files in case of 
  capital letters in file names
- modified export.design to handle factor labels with blanks from (future) GUI 
  package RcmdrPlugin.DoE
- added S3 generic for fix with default and design method
- extended design.info for output objects from function oa.design to include nruns, 
  nfactors and nlevels
- improved documentation of class design and the respective parts of the value 
  sections of functions oa.design and fac.design
- included function contr.FrF2 and constant Yates from package FrF2 
  (not exported; also remain in package FrF2)

27/06/2009   Version 0.3
- added list element creator to design.info attributes of created designs
  and improved documentation of class design and its accessors

26/05/2009   Version 0.2
- modified internal function html.data.frame, 
  so that top row of html file created by export.design 
  is only one row when file is opened in Excel 
  (changed top row formatting from <h3> to <b>)
- added options filename and replace to function export, 
  in order to protect users from inadvertent replacement of existing 
  files and to allow filenames different from design names
- moved documentation of constant Letters from oa.design.Rd 
  to Utilities.Rd
