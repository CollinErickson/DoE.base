This package is under development, and many parts are still considered experimental.

26/05/2009   Version 0.2
- modified internal function html.data.frame, 
  so that top row of html file created by export.design 
  is only one row when file is opened in Excel 
  (changed top row formatting from <h3> to <b>)
- added options filename and replace to function export, 
  in order to protect users from inadvertent replacement of existing 
  files and to allow filenames different from design names
- moved documentation of constant Letters from oa.design.Rd 
  to Utilities.Rd
